# Project Name: Can of Books App

**Author**: Monica  and Nerissa Leynes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This is a frontend server to our backend. This server will send a get request to the backend and should retrieve all of the books data from books collection.

## Getting Started

For this Lab, we will use Mongoose and MongoDB to create a NoSQL database. We will use axios to get the information from our server, the server will then connect to our DB, and send the response back to our front-end.

## Architecture

- Axios Express,
- React JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Change Log

10/31/2022 8:00pm EST - The application is now fully fuctional and can now connect to the database. It is now getting Book items.

11/01/2022 8:15pm EST - The application can now add data into the database (Post functionality)

## Team Agreement

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?\
  - Nerissa: 1:00pm  PST - 12:00am PST
  - Monica: 1:00pm  PST - 10:00pm PST
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - REMO, Slack
- How often will you take breaks?
  - Whenever we need to, if necessary
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Communicate concerns to each other and seek outside input.

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each person’s strengths
  - Nerissa: Styling pages, willingness to learn
  - Monica: Curious, Perseverance, Researching

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

  - We can bounce ideas off of each other and ask for input when we get stuck

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

  - Nerissa: I’d like to improve my skills in JavaScript, technical communication

  - Monica: I would like to sharpen my skills with JavaScript and Front End. Tool proficiency is a big area of growth for me as well as confidence.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

  - Code Review first thing before moving on to the next phase of the web app. Any concerns will be addressed at the beginning of the day

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

  - Communicate concerns, escalate when there is no resolution and seek outside input.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

  - Seek outside input.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  - Checking in with each other and implementing blocks of code incrementally will help us know where each of us are in terms of this project
