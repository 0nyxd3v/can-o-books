# Project Name: Can of Books App

**Author**: Monica  and Nerissa Leynes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This is a frontend server to our backend. This server will send a get request to the backend and should retrieve all of the books data from books collection.

## Getting Started

For this Lab, we will use Mongoose and MongoDB to create a NoSQL database. We will use axios to get the information from our server, the server will then connect to our DB, and send the response back to our front-end.

## Architecture

- Axios Express,
- React JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
