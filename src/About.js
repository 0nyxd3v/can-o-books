        <p>Hi, my name is Nerissa Leynes. I served eight years of Active Duty in the Navy and am currently in the reserves. I decided to pursue a career in the tech field because I found coding interesting, stressful, and challenging. Coding allows me to implement features and make the web page interactive. Also, Iâ€™d like to build an app and hope to work in a team with other software developers in the tech industry. Learn coding here with me in Norfolk, VA</p>
